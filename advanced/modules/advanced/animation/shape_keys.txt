shape key

cube mesh
add basis key
add another shape key
enter edit mode
select top 4 vertices
scale them into a single position
show morph from cube to pyramid
explain influence setting
explain relative shapekey
explain shape key visibility

enter edit mode
select top 4 vertices 
merge them at center (M)
show morph behaviour
-> when you edit a shape key you are editing
the mesh over all shape keys, as a shape key
merely provides a 3D offset for each vertex
    

can have multiple shape keys active
cube mesh
one key: translate one side in +x
another key: translate another side in +y
show morph options

explain "pin" icon
Shape Key Lock (pin icon)
Show the active shape in the 3D Viewport without blending. Shape Key Lock gets automatically enabled while the object is in Edit Mode.
Without Pin get the net result of blending all shape keys with their weight

explain default relative shape keys
    
absolute shape keys
? what happens when you use different topologies?


shape key rules:
- topology cannot change between shape keys (# vertices, plus geometry connections)


add cube mesh
add basis shape key
add second cube mesh, xform it
apply xform (ctrl a, all transforms)
notice transform UI values
select transformed cube, then shift-select basic cube
pick Join as Shapes
notice new shape key, named after xformed cube
show morph behaviour
btw, notice that shape key is still there when deleting morphed cube

remove xformed shape key
add 2nd cube, xform it, but leave xforms in place
select xformed cube, shift-select unit cube
pick Join as Shapes
notice that nothing happens when altering shape key


Tip: can have mesh to copy in a different location, shape key is based on object-space vertex positions




Exercise: provide two meshes
