        <h1>Advanced topics in scientific visualization with Blender: geometry, scripts, animation, action!</h1>
		<h2>Part 1: Introduction to Python Scripting in Blender</h2>
        
		<b>Period</b>: <text class="date">15-26 JUNE 2020</text><br>
		<b>Time investment</b>: three contact moments of half a day each. The rest of the time you work in your own time.<br>
        Location: online (multiple sessions)<br>
        <b>Registration</b>: <text class="registerdiv">(link coming)</text> (at most 16 participants)<br>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>In this course you will learn the basics of the Python API in Blender. You will learn how the API is 
		structured and eventually start making some simple geometry with code. Another important part of the course 
		is that you will work on a visualisation based on your own research or other endeavours. </p>
        
        <p>The course is set up to run over two weeks, beginning with an introductory webinar. During the course period 
        you work on the theory and exercises in your own time using the tutorials and video lectures. We provide a communication 
        channel with the course teachers that you can use for questions and feedback during the course. There are also 
        several webinars where you present your progress and we discuss your project and make sure you are able to make progress.
		Part of the course material, like our videos and tutorials, is also available outside the course timetable.</p>

		<h3>Your own project and data</h3>
		To get the most out of the course we would like you to take a dataset from your work that you want to use for 
		visualisation with Blender. This course will give you the skills to start on your own project. 
		During the interactive moments (webinars and chat channel) our visualisation team will help you further with 
		your specific project and challenges. So please collect some data you think would be great to make a 3D 
		visualisation of. During the webinars we will expect input from you also. We would like you to present your 
		visualisation goals, your data and your first try at making a visualisation with Blender.

		<h3>This course is a pilot</h3>
        Due to the Covid-19 situation we have decided to start an online course, as alternative to our regular on-site 
        courses. This course module is intentionally small because we want to test how and see if we can effectively 
        use online tools for our training programs, especially for a hands-on topic like using Blender. We hope that 
        you are open to giving us feedback on the setup and execution of this course. The next parts of the course will 
        be improved based on your input.

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Basic knowledge of Blender: getting around the interface, making and adding geometry, some basics on materials</li>
			<li> Basic knowledge of Python</li>
			<li> An idea and/or some data for your own project to work on during the course.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What you need</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Computer with Blender installed</li>
			<li> <a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_BLANK">Blender</a> version 2.83 LTS</li>
			<li> Internet connection to join us on <a href="#discord">Discord</a></li>
			<li> Account with Discord to join the chat and webinar server</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a id="webinars">The webinars</a></h2>
        
		<h3>What we will do during the webinars</h3>
		During the webinars we will not explain theory, but they will be interactive moments during the course for you to get feedback on your work. 
		They will be the moment for you to ask questions to our team. Questions about the theory and exercises in the course, but also the moment 
		for you to discuss what you want to do with Blender and how best to do this. Thus, the more you prepare for the webinar the more you can 
		get out of them!

		<h3>Prepare for the webinars</h3>
		<p>During the introduction webinar we hope you grace us with a brief introduction of who you are, why you wanted to do this 
		course and what you would like to get out of it. Maybe you have a project for which you want to make a visualisation with
		Blender?</p>
		<p>For the feedback webinars please prepare a short 5 min presentation telling us about your project and what you tried 
		to visualise with Blender and how. It will be a great opportunity to make progress!</p>
        

		<h3>How to join the webinar</h3>
        
        For the introduction webinar we will test Discord to see if it is capable of hosting a webinar. Please make sure you installed Discord, joined our server and requested to join the webinar channel. See instructions on installing Discord <a href="#discord">here</a>.
		<!-- You will be invited per mail to the webinars using Webex. Instructions will be included in the mail. For the best quality, download
		the desktop client of the software instead of using the internet browser to connect to the meeting. -->

        <!-- Depending on the number of registrations, we will organize the webinars through Discord's voice and video channels or through Webex. 
        Please make sure to join our Discord server before the webinar starts so we can invite you into the right channel. Here are 
        instructions on installing <a id="#discord">Discord</a>. Then join the designated webinar voice channel.-->


        <h2><a id="discord">Discord</a></h2>

        <p>We use a Discord server for text, audio and video communication.
        It also allows screen sharing to help you out where needed. </p>
       
        <p>To get started download the <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_BLANK">Discord</a> application and create an account.
        Note that the browser-based version of Discord does not always support streaming your screen/video, plus we experienced
        some audio issues with that version, hence we suggest to use the standalone application. </p>
        
        <p>In Discord join our server through <a href="https://discord.gg/mVjYzbm" target="_BLANK">https://discord.gg/mVjYzbm</a>
        and introduce yourself in the <tt>#general</tt> text channel so we can invite you into the course channels.</p>

        <p>Some more information on how to use Discord, see <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Started-with-Discord" target="_BLANK">this</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-use-discord" target="_BLANK">this</a>.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Where to start</h2>
        <p>Start with reading the <a href="https://surfsara-visualization.github.io/blendercourses/tutorials/site/" target="_BLANK">tutorials</a> and watching 
        the videos linked within. Also do the exercises in the tutorial and try to reproduce all that is done in the tutorial and the videos. When you are done 
    	with that, start your own project as described in the last chapter of the tutorials.</p>

        <p>One day before a <a href="#webinars">Feedback webinar</a> (check the <a href="#schedule">time table</a>), think about how you want to present your 
        project to the teachers and the other students during the webinar and prepare some material to share. What are you trying to do in your project? What 
    	works what does not work? Maybe have a screenshot or a screenshare of you visualisation ready.</p>

        <p>If you are stuck or do not know how to continue, drop us a line on the <a href="#discord">Discord</a> server. Or wait for 
        one of the <a href="#webinars">webinars</a> to ask a questions.</p>
