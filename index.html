        <h1>Advanced topics in scientific visualization with Blender: geometry, scripts, animation, action!</h1>
		<h2>Part 1: Introduction to Python Scripting in Blender</h2>
        
		Period: <text class="date">15-26 JUNE 2020</text><br>
        Location: online (multiple sessions)<br>
        Registration: <text class="registerdiv">(link coming)</text> (at most 16 participants)<br>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>In this course you will learn the basics of the Python API in Blender. You will learn how the API is 
		structured and eventually start making some simple geometry with code. Another important part of the course 
		is that you will work on a visualisation based on your own research or other endeavours (XXX or we can provide you 
		with data if you don't want to). </p>
        
        <p>The course is set up to run over two weeks, beginning with an introductory webinar. During the course period 
        you work on the assignments in your own time. We provide a communication channel with the course teachers that 
        you can use for questions and feedback during the course. There is also a webinar each week were we discuss your 
        projects and make sure you are able to make progress.
		Part of the course material, like our YouTube videos and tutorials, is available outside the course timetable.</p>

		<h3>Your own project or data</h3>
		To get the most out of the course we would like you to take a dataset from your work that you want to use for 
		visualisation with Blender. This course will give you the first skills to start and work on your own project. 
		During the interactive moments (webinars and chat channel) our visualisation team will help you further with 
		your specific project and challenges. So please collect some data you think would be great to make a 3D 
		visualisation of. During the webinars we will expect input from you also. We would like you to present your 
		visualisation goals, your data and your first try at making a visualisation with Blender.

		<h3>This course is a pilot</h3>
        Due to the Covid-19 situation we have decided to start an online course, as alternative to our regular on-site 
        courses. This course module is intentially small because we want to test how and see if we can effectively 
        use online tools for our training programs, especially for a hands-on topic like using Blender. We hope that 
        you are open to giving us feedback on the setup and execution of this course. The next parts of the course will 
        be improved based on your input.

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Basic knowledge of Blender: getting around the interface, making and adding geometry, some basics on materials</li>
			<li> Basic knowledge of Python</li>
			<li> An idea and/or some data for your own project to work on during the course. XXX do we provide data as an alternative? How about Ben's disk sim dataset?</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What you need</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Computer with Blender installed</li>
			<li> Blender version 2.82a</li>
			<li> Internet connection to join us on Discord</li>
			<li> Account with Discord to join the chat and webinar server</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a id="webinars">The webinars</a></h2>
        
		<h3>What we will do during the webinars</h3>
		The webinars will be interactive moments during the course. They will be the moment for you to ask questions to our team. Questions about the theory and exercises in the course, but also the moment for you to discuss what you want to do with Blender and how to do this. 

		<h3>How to join the webinar</h3>
        
		You will be invited per mail to the webinars. Instructions will be included in the mail. For the best quality, download
		the desktop client of the software instead of using the internet browser to connect to the meeting.

        <!-- Depending on the number of registrations, we will organize the webinars through Discord's voice and video channels or through Webex. 
        Please make sure to join our Discord server before the webinar starts so we can invite you into the right channel. Here are 
        instructions on installing <a id="#discord">Discord</a>. Then join the designated webinar voice channel.-->

		<h3>Prepare for the webinars</h3>
		During the introduction webinar we hope you grace us with a brief introduction of who you are, why you wanted to do this 
		course and what you would like to get out of it. Maybe you have a project for which you want to make a visualisation with
		Blender?
		<br><br>
		For the feedback webinars please prepare a short 5-10 min presentation telling us about your project and what you tried 
		to visualise with Blender and how. It will be a great opportunity to progress!

        
        <h2><a id="discord">Discord for webinars and chat</a></h2>

        <p>We use a Discord server for text, audio and video communication.
        It also allows screen sharing to help you out where needed. </p>
       
        <p>To get started download the <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_BLANK">Discord</a> application and create an account.
        Note that the browser-based version of Discord doesn't always support streaming your screen/video, plus we experienced
        some audio issues with that version, hence we suggest to use the standalone application. </p>
        
        <p>In Discord join our server through <a href="https://discord.gg/mVjYzbm">https://discord.gg/mVjYzbm</a>
        and introduce yourself in the <tt>#general</tt> text channel so we can invite you into the course channels.</p>
